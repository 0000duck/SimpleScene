*
*  TODO V1
*

- !!!    add some basic Nunit unit tests to OpenTK    !!!

- GLSL multi-texture shading ( GL 2.2 / GLSL 1.2 )
  - http://www.lighthouse3d.com/tutorials/glsl-tutorial/
  - http://www.learnopengles.com/android-lesson-two-ambient-and-diffuse-lighting/
  - (done) diffuse
  - (done) ambient/glow
  - (done) single-pass wireframe
  - specular
  - bump

- FIX camera/object transform
  - NEED: working camera rotation
  - NEED: working object rotation
  - NEED: working object translation

- mouse camera dolly/pan (shift drag)

-  wavefront OBJ bug/todo items
  - handle multi-line faces continued with "\"
  - handle negative vertex indices in face specification
  - handle "s" smoothing group
  - handle "Tr"/"d" material transparency/alpha
  - tests

- add VertexBuffer / IndexBuffer management
 
- texture finalizer/dispose

- HUD projection, simple text display (or integrate GUI toolkit?)
  - add stats text (verts/polys drawn, fps)

- face-selection (to demonstrate mouse-to-ray-to-geometry) - either click, or pre-selection highlight

- move screen projection computation to somewhere sensible

- code/ui to toggle draw modes (lines, flat/gourad, textured)

************************
*
*  WRITE ARTICLE : Cross-Platform 3d app in C# OpenTK
*
************************

************************
*
*  WavefrontOBJLoader ideas...
*

- switch to non-console app (put text-output in GUI?)

- write "streaming loader", so the model is not buffered in the loader

- write CR2 loader
  - http://dj1.willowmail.com/~jeske/Projects/PoserCR2/kuroyumes/poserfilespec/introduction.html

- simple b-rep editing (Radial Edge, or X-Maps)

- add Cycles offline rendering! (needs material editing)

************************
*
*  SimpleScene Features
*

- compute mesh bounding sphere/box...
  .. use sphere, then (optionally) box to do CPU frustrum culling
  .. http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch29.html


- integrate my Gui2d library

- support open-gl non-robust mode (for unretained assets)

- add ZIP asset archive support

- add triangle fans?

- mouse object/face picking
- projected texture "projected mouse cursor"

- GL caps enable/disable abstraction, which only changes things when render caps actually change

************************
*
*  OpenTK improvements
*

- BUG: OpenTK: why is windows mouse-wheel direction the opposite of mac trackpad two-finger? 
  - do we need to read the natural config paramater? did we get the direction wrong?

- extend to separate pinch-zoom vs double-finger gestures  (pinch zoom = precise scroll wheel)

- OpenTK Mac OpenGL 3.3/4.0 (cocoa window support)
  - https://github.com/Ollhax/opentk/commit/ee70e4a276e2fbc3135ee787ce6f9860d37011b8

- OpenTK window features (multi-window, live-resize)

************************
*
*  3D research / learning
*

- do something with materials ??

- GLSL 330, multi-pass ( glow-bloom, shadow maps, deferred lighting, ambient occlusion )

- implement Bunny LOD

- review OpenGL extensions ( http://www.opengl.org/registry/ )

************************
*
*  DONE
*

- (done) add basic light
- (done) mouse camera rotation
- (done) fix green ship (why is it green?!?)
