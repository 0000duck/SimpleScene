-------


- mouse camera pan (shift drag)



- GLSL 1.2 multi-texture shading
  - http://www.lighthouse3d.com/tutorials/glsl-tutorial/
  - http://www.learnopengles.com/android-lesson-two-ambient-and-diffuse-lighting/
 
- texture finalizer/dispose

- HUD projection, simple text display (or integrate GUI toolkit?)

- ARTICLE : Cross-Platform 3d app in C# OpenTK

Cleanup
-------

- why is windows mouse-wheel direction the opposite of mac trackpad two-finger? 
  - do we need to read the natural config paramater? did we get the direction wrong?

- ?? switch to non-console app (put text-output in GUI?)
- ?? compute object bounding-sphere and center 
- ?? GL caps enable/disable abstraction, which only changes things when render caps actually change
- ?? extend OpenTK to separate pinch-zoom vs double-finger gestures  (pinch zoom = precise scroll wheel)

DONE
-----

- (done) add basic light
- (done) mouse camera rotation
- (done) fix green ship (why is it green?!?)
