************************
*
*  TODO V1
*
  
- HUD projection, simple text display (or integrate GUI toolkit?)
- add stats text (verts/polys drawn, fps)

- fix lighting... it should not change as camera moves! 

- move screen projection computation so it only happens on win-resize
  - ( currently in OnRenderFrame )

- ADD: FPS limiting (to avoid out of control CPU usage)

- texture finalizer/dispose
- add VertexBuffer / IndexBuffer management



************************
*
*  WRITE ARTICLE : Cross-Platform 3d app in C# OpenTK
*

 - add more models ... switch out drone model?
 - add text HUD instructions and UI...
   - key to cycle models
   - key to toggle draw modes (lines, flat/gourad, textured)

  - wavefront OBJ file-format bug/todo items
   - handle multi-line faces continued with "\"
   - handle negative vertex indices in face specification
   - handle "s" smoothing group
   - handle "Tr"/"d" material transparency/alpha

************************
*
*  OTHER IDEAS
*

- more GLSL shading
  - specular
  - bump (compute tangent-space normals!)
  - http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/technical/opengl/creating-a-glsl-library-r2428

- face-selection (to demonstrate mouse-to-ray-to-geometry) - either click, or pre-selection highlight

- ADD: mouse camera dolly/pan (shift drag)

- switch to non-console app (put text-output in GUI?)

- write "streaming loader", so the model is not buffered in the loader

- write CR2 loader
  - http://dj1.willowmail.com/~jeske/Projects/PoserCR2/kuroyumes/poserfilespec/introduction.html

- simple b-rep editing (Radial Edge, or X-Maps)

- add Cycles offline rendering! (needs material editing)

************************
*
*  SimpleScene Features
*

- compute mesh bounding sphere/box...
  .. use sphere, then (optionally) box to do CPU frustrum culling
  .. http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch29.html

- integrate my Gui2d library (it's GDI specific, does this work on MonoMac?)

- support open-gl non-robust mode (for unretained assets)

- add ZIP asset archive support

- add triangle fans?

- mouse object/face picking
- projected texture "projected mouse cursor"

- GL caps enable/disable abstraction, which only changes things when render caps actually change

************************
*
*  OpenTK improvements
*

- BUG: OpenTK: why is windows mouse-wheel direction the opposite of mac trackpad two-finger? 
  - do we need to read the natural config paramater? did we get the direction wrong?

- extend to separate pinch-zoom vs double-finger gestures  (pinch zoom = precise scroll wheel)

- OpenTK Mac OpenGL 3.3/4.0 (cocoa window support)
  - https://github.com/Ollhax/opentk/commit/ee70e4a276e2fbc3135ee787ce6f9860d37011b8

- OpenTK window features (multi-window, live-resize, windowed-fullscreen)

************************
*
*  3D research ideas / learning
*

- implement editable boundary-rep

- performance test on very large mesh vs Blender, Maya, 3dsmax

- 3dviewport like "Xoliul's Shader" features
  http://viewportshader.com/
  http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?254243-Viewport-FX&p=2415138&viewfull=1#post2415138

- GLSL 330, multi-pass ( glow-bloom, shadow maps, deferred lighting, ambient occlusion )

- implement Bunny LOD


************************
*
*  DONE
*

- (done) GLSL multi-texture shading ( GL 2.2 / GLSL 1.2 )
  - http://www.lighthouse3d.com/tutorials/glsl-tutorial/
  - http://www.learnopengles.com/android-lesson-two-ambient-and-diffuse-lighting/
  - (done) diffuse
  - (done) ambient/glow
  - (done) single-pass wireframe

- (done) FIX camera/object transform
  - (done) NEED: working camera rotation
  - (done) NEED: working object rotation
  - (done) NEED: working object translation

- (done) add basic light
- (done) mouse camera rotation
- (done) fix green ship (why is it green?!?)
